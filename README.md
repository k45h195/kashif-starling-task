# kashif-starling-task
Starling technical task (React)

# prerequisite
You will need to run the proxy server for this web app to work. This is a separate app, which can be found in this git account (starling-task-proxy-server) 

# To run.
cd into the directory
to install the dependencies run **yarn**
Once the dependencies are installed, to run the server run **yarn start**
This will start the react app on port 3000. CORS headers are returned from the proxy server, so you shouldn't have to install any cors add-ons for the browser
